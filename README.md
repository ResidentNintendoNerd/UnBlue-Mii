# UnBlue Mii

NOTE: To work correctly on Dolphin, the virtual SD Card option must be enabled, and the "apps/UnBlue Mii" directory must exist in it.

Simple program that edits the System IDs of all Miis to match your console's, thereby removing the write protection/blue pants from them.

If this is your first time running the program, make a Mii named "Unblue Mii" in the Mii Channel first! 

ALSO PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE BACKUP YOUR WII'S MII DATABASE (/shared2/menu/FaceLib/RFL_DB.dat) BEFORE RUNNING THIS PROGRAM. THIS IS MY FIRST TIME WRITING CODE IN C++/DOING WII DEV. I DON'T TRUST MY OWN CODE AND NEITHER SHOULD YOU.

Massive thank you to thepikachugamer from Nintendo Homebrew for being a huge help and answering my questions!
